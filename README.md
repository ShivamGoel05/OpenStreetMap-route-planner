# Route Planning Application

Building a route planner by extending IO2D graphics rendering library and using the A* Search Algorithm for finding and displaying a path between any 2 points on a map, just as you might see in a desktop or mobile mapping application, using real map data from  [the OpenStreeMap project.](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

## Dependencies
* cmake >= 3.11.3
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 7.4.0
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same instructions as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Install and Build IO2D

Installation instructions for all operating systems can be found [here](https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl/blob/master/BUILDING.md). This library must be built in a place where CMake `find_package` will be able to find it.

###  Using _COREGRAPHICS/MAC_ to compile and build IO2D

* Change directory into the repo and `cd` into `thirdparty` folder and download IO2D files:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl
```

* Xcode currently comes with an old version of libc++ which lacks many of C++17 features required by IO2D. The easiest solution is to download a fresh build of libc++ from [here](http://releases.llvm.org/6.0.0/clang+llvm-6.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz). Export appropriate CXX and LD flags to make clang use this version of the standard library (replace <*NEWPATH*> with path of extracted archive contents):
```
export CXXFLAGS="-nostdinc++ -isystem<NEWPATH>/include/c++/v1"
export LDFLAGS="-L<NEWPATH>/lib -Wl,-rpath,<NEWPATH>/lib"
```

* Install HomeBrew package manager:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
* Install cmake:  `brew install cmake`
* Install make: `brew install make`
* Install pkg-config: `brew install pkg-config`
* Install libpng:  `brew install libpng`
* Install graphicsmagick: `brew install graphicsmagick`
* Install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php), since Brew doesn't have Cairo.
* Install Cairo: `sudo /opt/local/bin/port -N -k install cairo +x11`

* Update $PATH environment variable for Brew (whereas, MacPort does it automatically):
```
echo `export PATH="$(brew --prefix)/opt/make/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"` >> ~/.bash_profile
```

*  `cd` into `P0267_RefImpl` (in `thirdparty`),  and inside new `Debug` folder build and open the IO2D Xcode project:
```
mkdir Debug && cd Debug
cmake -G "Xcode" --config Debug "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" -DIO2D_DEFAULT=COREGRAPHICS_MAC ../.
open io2d.xcodeproj
```

* In Xcode,  set the active scheme to **ALL_BUILD** and click "Build and then run the current scheme" button and then change the scheme to **install** and click the same button.

> **Note**: IO2D is now built from the binary sources and will now be ready to use inside the project.

## Compiling and Running

### Compiling
To compile the project, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, run `cmake` and `make` as follows:
```
cmake ..
make
```

### Running
The executable will be placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```
./OSM_A_star_search
```
Or to specify a map file:
```
./OSM_A_star_search -f ../<your_osm_file.osm>
```
